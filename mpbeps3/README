These codes are part of the UPIC 2.0.1 Framework.  The primary purpose
of this framework is to provide trusted components for building and
customizing parallel Particle-in-Cell codes for plasma simulation.
The framework provides libraries as well as 3 different reference
applications illustrating their use.  The libraries are designed to
work with up to 3 levels of parallelization (using MPI for distributed
memory, OpenMP for shared memory, local vectorization).  Currently only
the first two are supported.  The reference applications are designed to
provide basic functionality common to many PIC codes, and are intended
to be customized and specialized by users for specific applications.
Currently, only spectral field solvers are currently supported, but the
particle methods are designed to be gneral.  In addition, other test
codes will also be provided, illustrating the use of some specific
component.  This is primarily intended to users who wish to incorporate
some component into an already existing code. Currently, only one test
code is provided.

There are 3 Fortran reference codes for electrostatic, electromagnetic,
and darwin models, called mpbeps2, mpbbeps2, and mpdbeps2, respectively.
They are designed for Linux but will also compile for Mac OS X.  OpenMP
and MPI are used for parallelization, but if MPI is not available, the
codes can be compiled for OpenMP only

To compile all of them, execute:

A number of Directories are being developed to provide test codes to
illustrate components of these codes.  These are primarily intended for
those who wish to incorporate only pieces of the code into their own
codes.  The first one of these is the directory Periodic which
shows how to solve for the potential, longitudinal electric field,
vector potential and magnetic field using periodic boundary conditions.

To compile all these codes in the current (mpbeps2) directory, execute:

make

To compile just one, execute:

make program_name

where program_name is either: mpbeps2, mpbbeps2, or mpdbeps2

The command to execute a program with both MPI and OpenMP varies from
one system to another.  One possible command is:

mpiexec -np nproc -perhost n ./program_name

where nproc is the number of processors to be used, and where n is the
number of MPI nodes per host.

By default, OpenMP will use the maximum number of processors it can find
on the MPI node.  If the user wants to control the number of threads, a
parameter nvpp can be set in the main program.  In addition, the
environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS may need to be set to the maximum
number of threads per node expected.

To compile all these codes without MPI, execute:

make noMPI

To compile just one, execute:

make program_name

where program_name is either: mbeps2, mbbeps2, or mdbeps2

To execute, type the name of the executable:

./program_name
