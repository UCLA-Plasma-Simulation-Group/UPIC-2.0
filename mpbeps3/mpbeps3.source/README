3D OpenMP/MPI Particle-in-Cell (PIC) BEPS3 codes

These codes are part of a set of 3d PIC codes for educational and
research use.  They are designed for Linux but will also compile for
Mac OS X.  OpenMP and MPI are used for parallelization, but if MPI is
not available, the codes can be compiled for OpenMP only.

The makefile is setup to use gcc and gfortran with Linux.  It should
also work with MacOS X.

There are 3 Fortran codes for electrostatic, electromagnetic, and darwin
models, called mpbeps3, mpbbeps3, and mpdbeps3, respectively.  To
compile all of them, execute:

make

To compile just one, execute:

make program_name

where program_name is either: mpbeps3, mpbbeps3, or mpdbeps3

The command to execute a program with both MPI and OpenMP varies from
one system to another.  One possible command is:

mpiexec -np nproc -perhost n ./program_name

where nproc is the number of processors to be used, and where n is the
number of MPI nodes per host.

By default, OpenMP will use the maximum number of processors it can find
on the MPI node.  If the user wants to control the number of threads, a
parameter nvpp can be set in the main program.  In addition, the
environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS may need to be set to the maximum
number of threads per node expected.

To compile all these codes without MPI, execute:

make noMPI

To compile just one, execute:

make program_name

where program_name is either: mbeps3, mbbeps3, or mdbeps3

To execute, type the name of the executable:

./program_name

The Fortran version can be compiled to run with double precision by
changing the Makefile (for gfortran, set the compiler options to:
OPTS90 = -O3 -fdefault-real-8 -fdefault-double-8)
