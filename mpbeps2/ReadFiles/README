This code is a sample program which illustrate how to read periodic
fields which have been written using simple Fortran IO by the mpbeps2
suite of PIC codes.  It is designed for Linux but will also compile for
Mac OS X.  The default compiler used is gfortran, but other compiler
flags are commented out.

No warranty for proper operation of this software is given or implied.
Software or information may be copied, distributed, and used at own
risk; it may not be distributed without this notice included verbatim
with each file.  If use of these codes results in a publication, an
acknowledgement is requested.

The makefile is setup to use gfortran with Linux.  It should also work
with MacOS X.

The executables created are called preadf2 and pvreadf2.

To compile the programs, execute:

make

To compile just one, execute:

make program_name

where program_name is either: preadf2 or pvreadf2

To execute, type the name of the executable:

./program_name

The Fortran version can be compiled to run with double precision by
changing the Makefile (for gfortran, set the compiler options to:
OPTS90 = -O3 -fdefault-real-8 -fdefault-double-8).  This is necessary if
if the code which wrote the data was compiled with double precision.

There is a simple built-in graphics library available which is normally
used for debugging.  It is shut off by default, but is available for
either Textronix, Postscript printers or X11 devices.

To turn it on for Fortran, search for the string: Fortran Graphics in
the Makefile, and comment out the symbol GOBJS for No graphics and
uncomment it either for Tektronix, Postscript or X1. The X11 option
requires that the library Ygl is installed and the symbol
LGOPTS = -lYgl -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11.

To run with Tektronix, open the window xterm -t before executing the
codes.

The Postscript printer generator produces a file called pgraph.ps, which
can be viewed with post-script viewers or converters.  The output file
can be very large, but it can be converted to pdf with substantial
compression.  For example, on the Macintosh, the program Preview will
convert and compress the large Postscript files to pdf and allow one to
easily move through this file.
