<H2>Changes from Version 4.2d -&gt; 4.2e:</H2>

(V 4.2e released 11. May 2007)

<UL>

<LI> Fixed broken irisgl/fdevice.h, updated examples/smile_{f77|xlf}.f

<LI> Removed obsolete library glwidget. This library can be found
     <a href="ftp://ftp.thp.uni-duisburg.de/pub/source/X11/glwidget.tar.gz">here</a>.

</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 4.2c -&gt; 4.2d:</H2>

(V 4.2d released 7. May 2007)

<UL>

<LI> Renamed directory gl to irisgl due to incompatibilities with case
insensitive filesystems

</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 4.1f -&gt; 4.2c:</H2>

(V 4.2c released 1. May 2007)

<UL>

<LI> Added picking & naming stuff

<LI> Added blendfunction()

<LI> Many fixes, especially in colormap mode under OpenGL bindings

</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 4.1e -&gt; 4.1f:</H2>

(V 4.1f released 8. Feb 2005)

<UL>

<LI> Added gsync() (only works with OpenGL bindings).

<LI> Added {XY}MAXSCREEN macro

<LI> Removed poly*() from Ygl.h, as they are not implemented yet.

</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 4.1b -&gt; 4.1e:</H2>

(V 4.1e released 3. Feb 2005)

<UL>

<LI> 3D support is on now by default, as OpenGL is assumed to be
     installed. If not, please set UseOpenGL 0 in Imakefile.

<LI> Updated the <A HREF="ReadMe.html">ReadMe</A> file to include the
     3D routines.

<LI> Several minor bug fixes which were reported over the years...

</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 4.0x -&gt; 4.1b:</H2>

(V 4.1b released 2. May 2002)

<UL>
<LI> Workaround to let OpenGL bindings work both on X servers with 
     PseudoColor/TrueColor (e.g. AIX) and on X servers with only
     TrueColor visuals (e.g. XFree).

<LI> Added method to dynamically determine the declaration of
     <TT>usleep()</TT>. Hope this works in all cases...

<LI> Added missing FORTRAN bindings for new 3D routines.

<LI> Fixed many bugs...

</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 3.2 -&gt; 4.0x:</H2>

(V 4.0 not released yet)

<UL>
<LI> Added 3D using OpenGL. Note that one must compile Ygl with OpenGL
     support (see Imakefile) and set the environment variable
     <B>YGL_OGL</B> to 1 to use these bindings. 

<LI> rectf's are now the same size as rect's. rectf's were 1 Pixel
     larger in both directions, as GL also had this feature on most cards.

<LI> Fixed bug in <TT>viewport()</TT> (Thanks to Oliver Bedford
     &lt;a2270269@athena.rrz.uni-koeln.de&gt;).

</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 3.1 -&gt; 3.2:</H2>

(V 3.2 not released yet)

<UL>
<LI> Fixed bug in FORTRAN header Yfgl.h, device <TT>WINCLO</TT> clashed
     with routine <TT>winclo()</TT>. Renamed device <TT>WINCLO</TT> to
     <TT>WINCLOSE</TT>. 

<LI> Fixed two bugs in <TT>getbutton()</TT>: <TT>getbutton(0)</TT> failed
     to return -1, <TT>getbutton()</TT> of <TT>qdevice()</TT>ed keys
     failed. 

<LI> Fixed bug in <TT>winconstraints()</TT> that also affected
     startup: Sometimes Ygl freezed in <TT>winopen()</TT> and one had
     to move the window to continue. Ygl then waited for a
     ConfigureNotify event that wasn't generated.

<LI> Added support for the DoubleBuffer extension. This extension is
     new in X11R6.1 and replaces the MultiBuffer extension. Set
     DoubleBuffer to 1 in Imakefile to compile Ygl with this
     extension. 

<LI> Fixed bug in mkprefix.

<LI> Added functions <TT>deflinestyle()</TT>, <TT>setlinestyle()</TT>,
     <TT>getlstyle()</TT>, <TT>lsrepeat()</TT>, <TT>getlsrepeat()</TT>.

<LI> Fixed bug in popup menu code that occured when the cmap visual
     differed from the default visual (as on XServers with a 12 bit
     PseudoColor visual).

<LI> Setting the environment variables <B>YGL_CV</B> or <B>YGL_RV</B>
     to -1 now forces Ygl to use the XServers default visual instead
     of the best visual for colormap/RGB mode.

<!--- <LI> Workaround bug in twm window manager that caused twm to core dump when Ygl used subwindows. --->

</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 3.0.3 -&gt; 3.1:</H2>

(V 3.1 released 6. May 1996)

<UL>
<LI> Changed Macros <TT>XR()</TT> and <TT>YR()</TT>, added rounding
     when converting <TT>float</TT> to <TT>int</TT> coordinates.

<LI> Fixed bug in <TT>viewport()</TT> that could cause the clipping
     region to be wrong.

<LI> Added routine <TT>logicop()</TT>.

<LI> Fixed some bugs in the FORTRAN bindings: Device routines
     (<TT>TIE()</TT>, <TT>QDEVIC()</TT>, <TT>UNQDEV()</TT>,
     <TT>QENTER()</TT>) now require <TT>INTEGER*4</TT> parameters as
     stated in the manpages. <TT>READPI()</TT>, <TT>WRITEP()</TT> now
     accept <TT>INTEGER*2</TT> color indices. (Thanks to Luca
     Formaggia &lt;forma@crs4.it&gt; for the bug report.)

<LI> Added routine <TT>getmatrix()</TT>.

<LI> Fixed bug in <TT>change_gc()</TT> and <TT>viewport()</TT>: Text
     was not clipped. 

<LI> Changed <TT>frontbuffer()</TT> to be ignored when not in
     doublebuffer mode. 

<LI> Changed <TT>qreset()</TT> to not remove saved mouse/key events.

<LI> Didn't fix <TT>getcpos()</TT> to return position relative to
     window, not to screen. This is a bug in GL, it is emulated in Ygl
     :-((( 

<LI> Fixed <TT>getorigin()</TT> to return coordinates relative to screen.

<LI> Fixed bug in ygl.c that caused windows not to get a
     <TT>REDRAW</TT> event after a window move.

<LI> Added CMap/RGBmode checks to several color routines.

<LI> Fixed bug in <TT>gl2ppm()</TT> that caused <TT>gl2ppm()</TT> to
     scramble colors when in doublebuffered RGBmode.

<LI> Fixed <TT>REDRAW</TT> events when in RGB mode (Expose events seem
     not to propagate...). Due to problems with RGB mode windows Ygl
     returned to the good old way of handling RGB windows,
     i.e. <TT>gconfig()</TT> closes the cmap/RGB window and opens a
     RGB/cmap window at the same position.

<LI> Fixed bug in popupmenu colors when using private colormap.

<LI> The changes history is in html format now (as you can see 8-).
</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 3.0.2 -&gt; 3.0.3:</H2>

(V 3.0.3 released 13. Dec 1995)

<UL>
<LI> Fixed bug in <TT>mapcolor()</TT> that may cause segmentation fault.

<LI> Ygl now ignores <TT>MappingNotify</TT> Events and doesn't report
     errors.

<LI> Ygl windows now have white background (again). The transparent
     windows were too confusing (I think).

<LI> Fixed bug in <TT>freepup()</TT> that may cause segmentation
     faults. Changed <TT>newpup()</TT> to recycle menu-IDs after
     <TT>freepup()</TT>. 

<LI> Changed declaration of <TT>usleep()</TT> to be compatible with AIX 4.1.

<LI> Changed Imakefiles to use <TT>NullParameter</TT> instead of nothing.
</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 3.0.1 -&gt; 3.0.2:</H2>

(V 3.0.2 released 13. Nov 1995)

<UL>
<LI> Added <TT>noborder()</TT> as dummy function.

<LI> Added support for <TT>readsource(SRC_FRONT)</TT>, needed in
     doublebuffer-mode to read pixels from the front window. Changed
     <TT>gl2ppm()</TT> to read from the front buffer.

<LI> Fixed bug in <TT>newpup()</TT> that may cause a segmentation fault in
     menus without <TT>%F</TT> callback.

<LI> <TT>getbutton()</TT> now can handle keyboard keys,
     eg. <TT>getbutton(AKEY)</TT> returns <TT>1</TT> when the key
     <TT>A</TT> is pressed at the moment when <TT>getbutton()</TT>
     is called. Note that it is better and faster to use the queue
     (<TT>qtest()</TT>/<TT>qread()</TT>) when you want to know if a
     key was pressed.
</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 3.0.0 -&gt; 3.0.1:</H2>

(V 3.0.1 released 23. Oct 1995)

<UL>
<LI> <TT>gl2ppm()</TT> now corrects the brightness of RGB windows.

<LI> Added menu.o to Makefile.std.

<LI> Added <TT>viewport()</TT> and <TT>getviewport()</TT>.

<LI> Added vertex drawing routines: <TT>bgnpoint()</TT>,
     <TT>endpoint()</TT>, <TT>bgnline()</TT>, 
     <TT>endline()</TT>, <TT>bgnclosedline()</TT>,
     <TT>endclosedline()</TT>, <TT>bgnpolygon()</TT>, 
     <TT>endpolygon()</TT>, <TT>v2s()</TT>, <TT>v2i()</TT>,
     <TT>v2f()</TT>, <TT>v2d()</TT>. Note that it's not 
     possible to change drawing attributes (color, ...) in the inner
     of a vertex pipeline in Ygl...

<LI> Added <TT>rpmv2()</TT>.

<LI> Added <TT>dopup()</TT> to FORTRAN bindings (forgot it in 3.0.0...).

<LI> Added <TT>readpixels()</TT>, <TT>writepixels()</TT>,
     <TT>readRGB()</TT>, <TT>writeRGB()</TT>. 
</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 2.9.5 -&gt; 3.0.0:</H2>

(V 3.0.0 released 23. Aug 1995)

<UL>
<LI> Added dithering to RGBmode. Dithering is controlled by the
     environment variable <B>YGL_DITHERSIZE</B> or shorter
     <B>YGL_DSZ.</B> With this 
     variable you can specify the size of the dither matrix. The
     default value is 4, leading to a 4x4 dither matrix. Valid values
     range from 0 to 6. On a normal 8 bit TrueColor visual ({3,3,2}
     bits {red,green,blue}) you obtain 113x113x49 = 625681 different
     "colors" with <B>YGL_DSZ=4</B>, leading to an effective screen
     depth of approx. 19 bits. The other values and the effective
     screendepths are:
<PRE>
       |  8 bit (3-3-2)  | 12 bit (4-4-4)  |  16 bit (6-5-5)
YGL_DSZ| # colors (bits) | # colors (bits) |  # colors (bits)
-------------------------------------------------------------
  0,1  |      256 ( 8  ) |     4096 (12  ) |     65536 (16  )
   2   |    10933 (13.4) |   226981 (17.8) |   3953125 (21.9)
   3   |   114688 (16.8) |  2515456 (21.3) |  44531200 (25.4)
   4   |   625681 (19.3) | 13997521 (23.7) | 249232081 (27.9)
   5   |  2354176 (21.2) | 53157376 (25.7) | 949029376 (29.8)
   6   |  6976981 (22.7) |158340421 (27.2) |2831006341 (31.4)
</PRE>
<LI> Note that dithering costs speed. You may set <B>YGL_DSZ=0</B> to
     disable dithering. If you are lucky and have a 24 bit TrueColor
     visual, <B>YGL_DSZ</B> is automatically set to zero. Affected
     routines:
     <TT>RGBcolor()</TT>, <TT>gRGBcolor()</TT>,
     <TT>cpack()</TT>, <TT>c3s()</TT>, <TT>c3i()</TT>,
     <TT>c3f()</TT>.
     See examples/rgbtest.c for an example. 

<LI> Added menu stuff. New functions: <TT>defpup()</TT>,
     <TT>newpup()</TT>, <TT>addtopup()</TT>, 
     <TT>dopup()</TT>, <TT>freepup()</TT>, <TT>setpup()</TT>. See
     examples/popup.c for details.  

<LI> Added C++ support to Ygl.h.

<LI> Fixed bugs in FORTRAN bindings. Unfortunately some of the FORTRAN
     names are not truncated to 6 chars due to nameing conflicts,
     SH*T. FORTRAN bindings must be lowercase...
<PRE>
 double_  -&gt; doublebuffer_
 gRGBcol_ -&gt; grgbcol_
 RGBcol_  -&gt; rgbcol_
 RGBmod_  -&gt; rgbmod_
 loadXf_  -&gt; loadxf_
 getXdpy_ -&gt; getxdpy_
 getXwid_ -&gt; getxwid_
 getXgc_  -&gt; getxgc_
</PRE>

<LI> Fixed bug in <TT>gl2ppm()</TT> that caused it to fail under newer
     versions of AIX32.

<LI> <TT>getXwid()</TT> returned <TT>Window*</TT> instead of
     <TT>Window</TT>, <TT>getXgc()</TT> returned <TT>GC*</TT> instead
     of <TT>GC</TT>. Fixed.

<LI> Added <TT>winX()</TT> to FORTRAN bindings.

<LI> Fixed cooperation of FORTRAN bindings and <B>YGL_PREFIX</B>.

<LI> Changed behaviour of <TT>prefposition()</TT> and
     <TT>winposition()</TT>. The given 
     values now describe the position of the drawing area, not the
     position of the window incl. window manager decorations.

<LI> A RGBmode window is now a child of the initially created colormap
     mode window. This simplified changing to RGBmode. Ygl now uses
     the property <TT>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</TT> to tell the window
     manager which colormaps are to be installed. This also fixed a
     bug when a subwindow of a cmap window was a RGB window. To toggle
     the colormaps is this case, use the window manager function 
     <TT>f.colormap</TT> in twm or <TT>f.next_cmap</TT> in mwm (see
     your window manager manual for details). 

<LI> Added the function <TT>getXdid()</TT>. <TT>getXdid()</TT> returns
     the window id of the drawable. This id differs from
     <TT>getXwin()</TT> when using RGBmode or doublebuffering.
</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 2.9.2 -&gt; 2.9.5:</H2>

(V 2.9.5 released 4. Jan 1995)

<UL>
<LI> Fixed <TT>gconfig()</TT> to save doublebuffer state when
     switching cmode and RGBmode. 

<LI> Function added: <TT>winX()</TT>

<LI> Note that <TT>winX(Display *dpy, Window win)</TT> has some
     limitations: 

<UL>
<LI> <TT>dpy</TT> will be ignored. Ygl always uses the environment
     variable <TT>DISPLAY</TT>. 

<LI> Changing the visual of a window with <TT>cmode()</TT> or
     <TT>RGBmode()</TT> (<TT>RGBmode()</TT>;<TT>gconfig()</TT>;) will
     change the X11 WindowID of the window. So after the code
<PRE>
  ...
  xwin = XCreateWindow(...);
  winX(dpy, xwin);
  RGBmode();
  gconfig();
     ...
</PRE>
     xwin is not valid anymore. You must get the new windowid with
<PRE>
  xwin = getXwid();
</PRE>

</UL>

<LI> New environment variable <B>YGL_PARENTWID</B> or
     <B>YGL_PWID</B> introduced. See the ReadMe file for further
     details. 

<LI> Ygl was distributed in terms of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC
     LICENSE. Since version 2.9.5, Ygl is distributed in terms of the
     GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. See the file LICENSE for
     further details. 

<LI> Ygl has no private XErrorHandler anymore, as the default error
     handler gives more information and it's O.K. to <TT>exit()</TT>
     when a X error occures. 
</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 2.9 -&gt; 2.9.2:</H2>

(V 2.9.2 not released)

<UL>
<LI> <TT>swapbuffers()</TT> didn't explicitely flush the X pipeline,
     so sometimes a <TT>swapbuffers()</TT> didn't have an immediate
     effect. 

<LI> Bug in <TT>winopen()</TT> fixed that caused Ygl not to work with
     <B>VisualID=0x0</B>.

<LI> Some calls to <TT>[rcm]alloc()</TT> were not checked for out of
     memory. Fixed. 
</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 2.8.1 -&gt; 2.9:</H2>

(V 2.9 not released)

<UL>
<LI> Added noop routine <TT>foreground()</TT>.

<LI> Individual key devices introduced in Version 2.8 now reports both
     <TT>KeyPress</TT> and <TT>KeyRelease</TT> events. See
     examples/lines.c for an example. 

<LI> Changed <TT>qread()</TT> to report only one <TT>REDRAW</TT> event
     after a window resize and window moves. This is done by
     interpreting both <TT>Expose</TT> and <TT>ConfigureNotify</TT>
     events as generators for <TT>REDRAW</TT> events.

<LI> Moved header Ygl.h, Yfgl.h and Yglprefix.h to X11 directory.
</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 2.8 -&gt; 2.8.1:</H2>

(V 2.8.1 released 8. Oct 1994)

<UL>
<LI> Fixed several bugs in FORTRAN bindings.

<LI> Added header file config.h.

<LI> Changed <TT>gversion()</TT> to return <TT>-1</TT> if display
     can't be opened (see example contrib/tools/xmap.c).
<LI> 
</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 2.7 -&gt; 2.8:</H2>

(V 2.8 not released)

<UL>
<LI> Function added: <TT>getgdesc()</TT>.

<LI> Added support for individual key devices, eg. <TT>F1KEY</TT>,
     <TT>UPARROWKEY</TT> and so on. This was done on public request.

<LI> Replaced <TT>XPointer</TT> with <TT>char*</TT>. <TT>XPointer</TT>
     isn't defined in X11R4.

<LI> Added some explicit type converters at calls to <TT>[cm]alloc</TT>.

<LI> Changed <TT>qdevice()</TT> and <TT>unqdevice()</TT> to return
     error when called before <TT>winopen()</TT>.

<LI> Rewrote <TT>qtest()</TT> and <TT>qread()</TT>. Now both use one
     function. Hope not to have introduced too much bugs :-)

<LI> When routines are called before <TT>winopen()</TT> or
     <TT>ginit()</TT> or after <TT>gexit()</TT> that don't work at
     this point, the error message now includes the function name. 

<LI> Fixed <TT>winset()</TT> and <TT>winclose()</TT> to handle invalid
     window ids correctly.

<LI> Fixed <TT>[cl ]rectread()</TT> to work when a window is completely
     visible again after it was not completely visible.

<LI> Changed <TT>gl2ppm()</TT> to report broken pipes (invalid shell
     commands and so on).

<LI> Included FORTRAN bindings for all Ygl functions. The FORTRAN
     versions of all functions have an underscore appended, so the
     FORTRAN compiler must append a <TT>_</TT> to all names. f2c does
     this, xlf (under AIX 3.2) requires the option
     <TT>-qextname</TT>. See smile_f77.f for an example program. Set
     <TT>FortranBindings</TT> to 0 in Imakefile or change
     Makefile.std if you don't want these bindings. FORTRAN bindings
     are not tested because I have no programs.f to test. If you find
     bugs, feel free to report them to me.

<LI> Small change to colormap handling to reduce technicolor effects
     when using a private colormap (<B>YGL_PCM=1</B>) on displays
     not capable of more than one colormap at a time: Now the default
     colormap is copied to the private colormap and all entries in the
     private colormap count from the end of the colormap. So a
     <TT>mapcolor(i,r,g,b)</TT> changes colorcell <TT>255-i</TT> (in 8
     bit deep visuals) instead of cell i to reduce overlapping of
     private colorcells and cells already in use by other applications.

<LI> Extended selection of cmapmode visuals. Now cmapmode can also run
     on TrueColor and DirectColor visuals. This is for XServers that
     only have True/DirectColor visuals.
</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 2.6 -&gt; 2.7:</H2>

(V 2.7 released 22. Jun 1994)

<UL>
<LI> Functions added:
	<TT>getmcolors()</TT>,
	<TT>getdisplaymode()</TT>,
	<TT>setbell()</TT>,
	<TT>ringbell()</TT>,
	<TT>gl2ppm()</TT>,
	<TT>frontbuffer()</TT>,
	<TT>backbuffer()</TT> 

<LI> Changed filtering of <TT>Expose</TT> events. Now even more
     <TT>Expose</TT> events for a window are filtered to minimize
     redraws.

<LI> XMULIB in Imakefile is also used in ibmLib.tmpl :-(. Changed to
     THEXMULIB. 

<LI> Simplified code for handling of <TT>tie()</TT>s.

<LI> <TT>gl2ppm()</TT> is a subroutine that will write out the active
     [Y]gl window to a PPM file or pipe it through a shell
     command. Usage: 
<PRE>
 int <TT>gl2ppm(char</TT> *filename);
</PRE>
     <TT>popen()</TT> is used instead of <TT>fopen()</TT> when
     <TT>filename[0] == '|'</TT>. For an example, see examples/lines.c.

<LI> <TT>WINCLOSE</TT> device changed to <TT>WINQUIT</TT> due to
     incompatibility with SGI's GL. Please change <TT>WINCLOSE</TT> to
     <TT>WINQUIT</TT> in your source code.

<LI> A <TT>REDRAW</TT> event is sent when a window is moved. This is not
     nessesary for redrawing but for getting the new origin of the
     window. Unfortunally SGI's GL has no unique event for window
     moves (<TT>ConfigureNotifyEvent</TT>)...
</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 2.5 -&gt; 2.6:</H2>

(V 2.6 released 3. May 1994)

<UL>
<LI> <TT>getcpos()</TT> was wrong when using
     <TT>ortho2()</TT>. Fixed.

<LI> <TT>charstr()'s</TT> update of character position was wrong when
     using <TT>ortho2</TT>. Fixed. 

<LI> <TT>loadXfont()</TT> crashed when compiled with some non-ansi
     compilers due to <TT>realloc(NULL, ...)</TT>. Changed.

<LI> <TT>qdevice()/unqdevice()</TT> couldn't change device list while
     a mouse button was pressed due to active pointer grabs. Changed.

<LI> <TT>linewidth()</TT> now only changes GCs when
     <TT>linewidth()</TT> has changed.

<LI> Several minor speedups.

<LI> <TT>ortho2()</TT> now detects empty [xy]-ranges.

<LI> Spurious errors "Ygl: X Error: BadColor (invalid Colormap
     parameter) on 0x2000002" showed up when quitting programs with
     private colormap (eg. example/colormap). Fixed.
</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 2.4 -&gt; 2.5:</H2>

(V 2.5 released 28. Apr 1994)

<UL>
<LI> The following functions are added:
	<TT>tie()</TT>,
	<TT>winpop()</TT>,
	<TT>winpush()</TT>,
	<TT>getlwidth()</TT>,
	<TT>swinopen()</TT>,
	<TT>getfont()</TT>,
	<TT>getfontencoding()</TT>,
	<TT>getcpos()</TT>,
	<TT>winconstraints()</TT>,
	<TT>noport()</TT>.

<LI> Minor Changes to <TT>qreset()</TT>, <TT>qread()</TT>, and
     [I]makefiles.

<LI> Bug fixed that might cause <TT>getcolor()</TT> to return the
     wrong color when using multiple windows.

<LI> Bugs fixed that caused <TT>linewidth()</TT> and fonts not to be
     per window. 

<LI> Bug fixed that caused <TT>prefposition()</TT> to measure from top
     left corner instead of bottom left corner.

<LI> <TT>getmcolor()</TT> returned the X color, not the Ygl
     color. Fixed. 

<LI> The <TT>rect*()</TT> and <TT>sbox*()</TT> routines now draw rects
     inclusive the edges, i.e. <TT>rectf(1,1,2,2)</TT> is a 2x2 rect,
     not a 1x1 rect as before. Old versions of IBMs GL draw 1x1 rects,
     but this seems to have been fixed...

<LI> Three new environment variables <B>YGL_SINGLEGC</B>,
     <B>YGL_CMAPVISUAL</B> and <B>YGL_RGBVISUAL</B> has been
     added. See the ReadMe file for a description.

<LI> <TT>REDRAW</TT> events are now queued by default.

<LI> Changed example/rgb.c to demonstrate usage of <TT>tie()</TT> and
     renamed it to rgbtest.c.

<LI> Changed example/lines.c to demonstrate usage of
     <TT>swinopen()</TT>. 

<LI> Header file Ygl.h is now installed automatically when using
     imake. 

<LI> New define in Imakefile to use (experimental) support for global
     standard colormaps (see xstdcmap(1)). 

<LI> The ReadMe file is in html format now. Use Mosaic or emacs
     w3-mode (or other www viewer) to read. The latest version of this
     ReadMe is available at the World Wide Web: <BR>

<H2>Changes from Version 2.3 -&gt; 2.4:</H2>

(V 2.4 released 1. Feb 1994)

<UL>
<LI> The following functions are added:
	<TT>rectcopy()</TT>,
	<TT>cpack()</TT>,
	<TT>c3s()</TT>,
	<TT>c3i()</TT>,
	<TT>c3f()</TT>,
	<TT>linewidth()</TT>,
	<TT>rect{read|write}()</TT>,
	<TT>getXgc()</TT>,
	<TT>crect{read|write}()</TT>.

<LI> <TT>getXgc()</TT> is not included in standard GL. It returns a
     pointer to the graphics context just like <TT>getXdpy()</TT>
     returns a pointer to the display. You can for example use it to
     draw lines etc. XORed with the background: 

<PRE>
  #include <X11/X.h>
  ...
  XSetFunction(getXdpy(), getXgc(), GXxor);
</PRE>

<LI> <TT>crect{read|write}()</TT> are also not in standard GL. They
     work the same as <TT>lrect{read|write}()</TT>, they only
     {read|write} the data to a <TT>char</TT> array instead of
     <TT>Int32</TT> array. This is to speed up Colormap mode operations. 

<LI> Bug in timer handling fixed which caused flushtimes >= 1 second
     to be ignored.

<LI> Small bugs in <TT>lrect{read|write}()</TT> fixed.

<LI> All <TT>rect*()</TT> and <TT>sbox*()</TT> routines now draw
     rectangles even when x2 &lt; x1 or y2 &lt; y1,
     i.e. <TT>rect(10,10,20,20)</TT> is the same as 
     <TT>rect(20,20,10,10)</TT>. <TT>circ*()</TT> and <TT>arc*()</TT>
     routines now interpret negative radii as zero. 

<LI> <TT>doublebuffer()</TT> and <TT>singlebuffer()</TT> are now
     available in the library even when not compiled with -DMULTIBUF.
     
<LI> A new example program "smile.f" illustrates how to call Ygl
     routines from Fortran under AIX.
</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 2.2 -&gt; 2.3:</H2>

(V 2.3 released 12. Jan 1994)

<UL>
<LI> The following functions are added:
	<TT>lrectread()</TT>,
	<TT>lrectwrite()</TT>,
	<TT>readsource()</TT>.

<LI> <TT>lrectread()</TT> returns the same array as the GL version.

<LI> DirectColor visuals are supported, too, now.
</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 2.1 -&gt; 2.2:</H2>

(V 2.2 released 9. Jan 1994)

<UL>
<LI> You don't need to recompile the X-Server anymore to use
     doublebuffering under AIX 3.2.5 (AIXWindows 1.2.3). You simply
     have to add the option <TT>-x mbx</TT> to the X-Servers command
     line on startup. Additionaly, the multibuffer routines under AIX
     are in libXext.a now (as they should...).

<LI> Bug in <TT>qread()</TT> (Alt/Ctrl keys were reported as normal
     keys) fixed. 

<LI> Bug in <TT>qtest()</TT> that eventually caused unknown events to
     block the queue fixed.

<LI> The following function is added: <TT>ortho2()</TT>.
</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 2.0 -&gt; 2.1:</H2>

(V 2.1 released 25. Oct 1993)

<UL>
<LI> Name of library changed to Ygl due to a nameing conflict with
     SUNs XGL library.

<LI> All environment vars now starts with <B>YGL_</B>. The old names
     remains valid for compatibility reasons.

<LI> <TT>Xgl_Prefix</TT> -&gt; <TT>Ygl_Prefix</TT> and all names are
     prepended with <TT>ygl_</TT>. Change file mkprefix to get the old
     <TT>xgl_</TT> prefix.

<LI> gversion returns <TT>Ygl:X11-x.y.z</TT> (not
     <TT>Xgl:X11-x.y.z</TT>).

<LI> Example programs and {Im|M}akefiles revisited.

<LI> <TT>Button{Press|Release}</TT> events are only received when
     nessesary now.

<LI> Bugs in <TT>rdr()</TT> and <TT>arc()/arcf()</TT> fixed. They
     didn't work as expected... 

<LI> Bug in <TT>charstr()</TT> to RGB windows fixed (core dumped).

<LI> Bug in <TT>winclose()</TT> fixed.

<LI> Support for StaticGray visual added. Ygl now runs on Monochrome
     servers (again) (eg. XFree under Linux). 

<LI> Colormaps are now only installed when the server has room for
     them. This avoids the colormap switches on startup.

<LI> The following function is added: <TT>gRGBcolor()</TT>.
</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 1.3 -&gt; 2.0:</H2>

(V 2.0 released 21. Oct 1993)

<UL>
<LI> BackingStore support added. Set <TT>XGL_BACKINGSTORE=1</TT>.

<LI> RGBmode and support for other visual types is added. Xgl can run
     in a per window RGB mode, if the X-Server has a TrueColor
     visual. Xgl will always select the appropiate visual for the
     desired mode, independent of the default visual, ie:
<PRE>
 Colormap mode <-> PseudoColor or GrayScale visual
 RGB mode      <-> TrueColor visual
</PRE>

<LI> Short names for environment variables added:
<PRE>
 XGL_FT  for XGL_FLUSHTIME
 XGL_PCM for XGL_PRIVATECOLORMAP
 XGL_BS  for XGL_BACKINGSTORE
</PRE>

<LI> The following functions are added:
	<TT>winmove()</TT>,
	<TT>winposition()</TT>,
	<TT>ginit()</TT>,
	<TT>RGBmode()</TT>,
	<TT>RGBcolor()</TT>,
	<TT>cmode</TT>.

<LI>Two routines <TT>arcx()</TT> and <TT>arcxf()</TT> that are not
     part of standard GL are contributed by
     michael@thp.Uni-Duisburg.DE. With this routines you can draw
     outlined and filled _elliptic_ arcs. 

<LI> All drawing functions are implemented with floating-point
     arguments, i.e.:
	<TT>pnt2()</TT>,
	<TT>move2()</TT>,
	<TT>draw2()</TT>,
	<TT>rmv2()</TT>,
	<TT>rdr2()</TT>,
	<TT>arc()</TT>,
	<TT>arcf()</TT>,
	<TT>circ()</TT>,
	<TT>circf()</TT>,
	<TT>rect()</TT>,
	<TT>rectf()</TT>,
	<TT>sbox()</TT>,
	<TT>sboxf()</TT>,
	<TT>pmv2()</TT>,
	<TT>pdr2()</TT>,
	<TT>rpdr2()</TT>,
	<TT>poly2()</TT>,
	<TT>polf2()</TT>,
	<TT>cmov2()</TT>.

<LI> A bug in <TT>prefposition()</TT> is fixed that caused
     <TT>prefposition()</TT> to not work... 

<LI> All routines that talk to the X-Server now check for correct
     initialisation. This may slow down Xgl a very little bit. You can
     undefine <TT>CHECKDISPLAY</TT> in header.h get the old method
     (which is also used by GL :-).

<LI> You can set <TT>Xgl_Prefix</TT> to 1 in Imakefile and do a
<PRE>
# xmkmf -a;make clean;make
</PRE>
     to compile a library named libXglp.a where all function names are
     prepended with <TT>xgl_</TT>. This is to avoid name conflicts if
     you want to use Xgl in other projects as the Turbo Pascal for
     Unix emulator by Michael Staats (michael@thp.Uni-Duisburg.DE).
</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 1.1.1 -&gt; 1.3:</H2>

(V 1.3 released 24. Aug 1993)

<UL>
<LI> The following functions are added:
	<TT>rmv2s()</TT>,
	<TT>rmv2i()</TT>,
	<TT>rdr2i()</TT>,
	<TT>rdr2s()</TT>,
	<TT>winclose()</TT>,
	<TT>strwidth()</TT>,
	<TT>getheight()</TT>,
	<TT>getdescender()</TT>.

<LI> The <TT>qtest()</TT> and <TT>qread()</TT> routines can now
     distinguish between <TT>LEFTMOUSE</TT>, <TT>MIDDLEMOUSE</TT> and
     <TT>RIGHTMOUSE</TT> and support <TT>MOUSEX</TT> and
     <TT>MOUSEY</TT> events. 

<LI> Setting <TT>XGL_FLUSHTIME</TT> to <TT>-1</TT> will put the
     XServer into synchronous mode (see <TT>XSynchonize)</TT>. This
     mode seems to be veeeryyy slooow, but is good for debugging... 
</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 1.1 -&gt; 1.1.1:</H2>

(V 1.1.1 not released)

<UL>
<LI> A bug in <TT>qread()</TT> is fixed that caused too much
     <TT>Expose</TT> events (<TT>REDRAW</TT>) to be filtered out. XGL
     filters out all <TT>Expose</TT> events that are directly followed
     by another <TT>Expose</TT> event for the same window. In versions
     prior to 1.1.1, <TT>qread()</TT> filtered out ALL <TT>Expose</TT>
     events that were followed by another <TT>Expose</TT> event, even
     for another window :-(
</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 1.0.1 -&gt; 1.1:</H2>

(V 1.1 released 15 Jul 1993)

<UL>
<LI> The function <TT>getorigin()</TT> returned the position of the
     upper left corner in X11 coordinates rather than the position of
     the lower left corner in GL coordinates.

<LI> The function "<TT>gflush()</TT>" is no longer supported. Use
     <TT>sleep(0)</TT> to flush the graphics pipeline instead.

<LI> XGL supports doublebuffering via the "Multi-Buffering" server
     extension. This extension is new in X11R5 and is included in the
     lpp X11dev.src under AIX 3.2. To use doublebuffering you have to
     link the "Multi-Buffering" extension into your X-Server (AIXlers,
     see /usr/lpp/X11/Xamples/README, "Linking the Sample Extensions
     into the Server"). The related GL routines are
     <TT>doubleduffer</TT>, <TT>swapbuffer()</TT> and
     <TT>singlebuffer()</TT>.

<LI> The following functions are added:
	<TT>getmcolor()</TT>,
	<TT>getcolor()</TT>,
	<TT>gconfig()</TT>,
	<TT>singlebuffer()</TT>,
	<TT>swapbuffers()</TT>,
	<TT>doublebuffer()</TT>,
	<TT>getvaluator()</TT>,
	<TT>getbutton()</TT>,
	<TT>concave()</TT>,
	<TT>poly2i()</TT>,
	<TT>poly2s()</TT>,
	<TT>polf2i()</TT>,
	<TT>polf2s()</TT>.
</UL>

<H2>Changes from Version 1.0 -&gt; 1.0.1:</H2>

(V 1.0.1 released 7 Jul 1993)

<UL>
<LI> The refresh time and the use of the colormap is now controlled
     via two environment variables (<TT>XGL_PRIVATECOLORMAP</TT> and
     <TT>XGL_FLUSHTIME</TT>) and no longer through external variables
     due to problems with shared libraries. 

<LI> libXgl.a is now a shared library under AIX and the linker option
     -lX11 can be omitted.
</UL>

<H2>Initial Version 1.0:</H2>
