    Ygl: Run 2d-GL programs with standard X11 routines.

Ygl is written in ANSI C, so use gcc if you have problems during
compilation. To compile Ygl, follow the following steps:

If you have imake, enter:

$ xmkmf
$ make

else edit the file Makefile and type

$ make

On RS/6000, ignore the warnings from the linker.

If the compiler can't find the include file
<X11/extensions/multibuf.h> or the linker can't find functions like
"XmbufDisplayBuffers", undefine MultiBuffer in the Imakefile. You
won't be able to do doublebuffering then.

Note for AIX 4.1:
You need the LPP X11.adt.ext to compile Ygl with doublebuffering
enabled. 

To make the examples, do a:

$ cd examples
$ xmkmf        # if you have it
$ make

If you have GL, enter "make gl" to compile the GL versions of the
examples. 

To make the FORTRAN examples, enter:

$ make smile_f77 smile_f2c

To install the library and the include files Ygl.h and Yfgl.h, type
(as root) 

$ make install

If you want the GL-style include files, and Ygl.h and Yfgl.h were
installed in /usr/include/X11, enter (as root):

$ mkdir /usr/include/gl
$ cd /usr/include/gl
$ ln -s /usr/include/X11/Ygl.h gl.h
$ ln -s /usr/include/X11/Ygl.h device.h
$ ln -s /usr/include/X11/Yfgl.h fgl.h
$ ln -s /usr/include/X11/Yfgl.h fdevice.h

The program "lines.c" is included to test the library and to
compare the performance with standard GL. 

The program "coltest.c" is an example for the use of a private
colormap.

The program "rgbtest.c" opens both a colormap mode and a RGBcolor
window (if your X-Server has a {True|Direct}Color visual...)

The program "smile.c" is very simple...

The program "smile_f77.f" does same like "smile.c" in FORTRAN.

Have fun... Fred
