<DT> <B>Q 1:</B>
<DD> We have an SGI Indigo on which we run a number of softwares that
use GL and which are provided to us as binaries. Since we have an X
terminal networked to this station we would be interested in using it
to run these softwares. Do you think that <CITE>Ygl</CITE>
could be used for such a purpose ? 
<DT> <B>A 1:</B>
<DD> I don't think this is possible. Normally you must have the source of
the GL application and relink it with libYgl.a instead of
libgl.a. This relink will fail if the application uses routines that
are not implemented in <CITE>Ygl</CITE>, ie. all 3D stuff,
object stuff and so on. There is one known case where you don't need
the sources: 
<BR>
You have shared libraries and both libgl.a and libYgl.a are shared
libs (True under AIX3). Then you can make a directory eg. ~/lib and
prepend ~/lib to the libpath. Under AIX3 this is done by setting the
environment variable LIBPATH to <TT>"~/lib:/usr/lib"</TT>, under Linux
the variable is called LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Then move libYgl.a to
~/lib/libgl.a and try to run your application. If you get errors like
"symbol xxx in yyy is undefined" the application requires routines
that are not part of Ygl. If you are lucky the program runs. 
<P><DT> <B>Q 2:</B>
<DD> I have installed Linux + XFree86 on a PC486. If i run programs 
on remote machines, everything goes all right as long as the program
(run on SGI machines) does not use GL. Otherwise, an error message is
displayed:

<PRE>
dlg error (protocol): remote machine not DGL capable - machinename:0
dgl error (default init): default dglopen(machinename:0,4) returned -13
</PRE>

Do you think that <CITE>Ygl</CITE> can do the trick and make my
machine "DGL capable" ? 

<DT> <B>A 2:</B>
<DD> No. You need distributed GL (DGL). DGL is an old extension to GL
to make GL networkable. As far as I know, DGL only runs on SGIs (both
client and server). There is only a small chance that you can solve
your problem with Ygl (see A1).

<P><DT> <B>Q 3:</B>
<DD> When using <CITE>Ygl</CITE> together with C++ under HP-UX
(i.e. with the compiler <TT>CC</TT>), the float versions of the
drawing commands apparently don't do anything and functions like
<TT>ortho2()</TT> keep complaining about zero height/width. What's
wrong? 

<DT> <B>A 3:</B>
<DD> <CITE>Ygl</CITE> is written (and thus compiled) in ANSI C. For a
proper communication between C++ and ANSI C (especially
float &lt;-&gt; double) you have to use the option <TT>+a1</TT>
